## Project 1: Manuscript

This is a demo/example repository for our [first project](https://typography-interaction-2425.github.io/project/1/) in [*Typography & Interaction, 2024–2025*](https://typography-interaction-2425.github.io/).

Our first project demonstrates HTML and semantic DOM, basic CSS, as well as type hierarchy and the use of custom typefaces for the web. Students chose [a relevant text](https://readings.design/) and responded to it, then typeset their selection and reply together as a web page. This repo indicates some of the hierarchy, structure, and CSS we’re looking for.

It was written “by hand” (keyboard) by [@mfehrenbach](https://github.com/mfehrenbach) using Visual Studio Code, and is [hosted here](https://typography-interaction-2425.github.io/manuscript/) on GitHub Pages.
